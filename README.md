# Dataset

**Twitter:**  A publicly available dataset [1] was used as training data for the model on the Twitter platform. Since the dataset is publicly available, we do not provide the source dataset. Subsequently, a processed version of the dataset that takes up little memory (original) and a version of the dataset that can be trained directly are provided.

**Weibo:** Because official datasets for studying spammers on the Weibo platform are scarce and user information is non-recourseable. Therefore, we constructed the fully open-source Weibo dataset. A detailed description of the <u>collection process</u> and <u>user label definitions</u> for this dataset can be found in the file **Supplement_for_Reproducibility.md**.
